I am an Associate Professor (Førsteamanuensis) in Linguistics at the University
of Oslo, in the [Department of Linguistics and Scandinavian
Studies](https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/). The main focus of my work is on
using computational and mathematical tools to explore syntax and semantics (I
don't think the two can be meaningfully studied in isolation<span
class="popup-note" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It's a pity that Haj Ross's
hybrid term &ldquo;semantax&rdquo; didn't catch on."
data-placement=right>*</span>). But I am interested in all areas of grammatical
theory (including meta-theory), and in all areas of linguistics more broadly: as
well as syntax and semantics, my research has touched on sociolinguistics,
pragmatics, and cognitive linguistics.
