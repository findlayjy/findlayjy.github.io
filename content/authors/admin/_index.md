I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Semantics at the University of Oslo,
where I am part of the [Universal Natural Language Understanding
project](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/en/project/FORISS/300495?Kilde=FORISS&distribution=Ar&chart=bar&calcType=funding&Sprak=no&sortBy=date&sortOrder=desc&resultCount=30&offset=0&TemaEmne.2=eVitenskap)
[[{{<icon name = "github" pack = "fab">}}](https:www.github.com/Universal-NLU)].
The main focus of my work is on using computational and mathematical tools to
explore syntax and semantics (I don't think the two can be meaningfully studied
in isolation<span class="popup-note" data-toggle="tooltip" title="It's a pity
that Haj Ross's hybrid term &ldquo;semantax&rdquo; never caught on."
data-placement=right>*</span>). But I am interested in all areas of grammatical
theory (including meta-theory), and in all areas of linguistics more broadly: as
well as syntax and semantics, my research has touched on sociolinguistics,
pragmatics, and cognitive linguistics.
