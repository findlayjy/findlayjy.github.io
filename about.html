      <h1>About</h1>
      <img src="pictures/jamie_oxford.png" alt="Me in Oxford" id="oxford_pic"/>
      <p>I am a theoretical linguist, which means I study human language from a scientific perspective. I come up with theories about how it works and why, and then test them. In particular, I am interested in the structure of sentences (syntax), how the meanings of sentences are computed (semantics), and the ways in which these two interact.</p>

      <p>I am currently a doctoral student, and my thesis (supervised by <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~cpgl0015/" target="_blank">Mary Dalrymple</a> and <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~cpgl0036/index.html" target="_blank">Ash Asudeh</a>) is about multiword expressions (such as idioms like <i>pull strings</i> or <i>cut the mustard</i>) and how they should be represented in the mental lexicon.</p>

      <p>My work mostly uses <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/external/lfg/" target="_blank">Lexical Functional Grammar</a>, a constraint-based (non-derivational) grammatical framework, and I am interested more broadly in well-formalised theories of grammar.</p>

      <p>I am also interested in sociolinguistics, and especially in the intersection of language, gender, and sexuality. I have done some work in this area using critical discourse analysis, and hope to do more.</p>

      <p>Outside of linguistics, I enjoy techy things, strategy gaming, and being a card-carrying SJW.</p>
