      <h1>About</h1> <img src="pictures/jamie_oxford.png" alt="Me in Oxford"
      id="oxford_pic"/>
      <p>I am a theoretical linguist: I come up with theories about how human
      language works and then I test them. In particular, I am interested in the
      structure of sentences (syntax), how the meanings of sentences are
      computed (semantics), and the ways in which these two interact.</p>

      <p>Professionally, I am a Departmental Lecturer in Syntax at the
      University of Oxford. My teaching includes general linguistics, syntax,
      and sociolinguistics.</p>

      <p>Research-wise, I am interested in well-formalised theories of grammar
      and meaning, especially constraint-based, non-derivational theories (such
      as <a href="http://ling.uni-konstanz.de/pages/home/lfg/"
      target="_blank">Lexical Functional Grammar</a>). My recent work has mostly
      focussed on the syntax and semantics of idioms and other multiword
      expressions, investigating how they should be represented in the mental
      lexicon. I also study the principles behind how the semantic arguments
      of a predicate are realised syntactically, otherwise known as Mapping
      Theory.

      <p>Beyond syntax and semantics, I am also interested in sociolinguistics,
      and especially in the intersection of language, gender, and sexuality.</p>

      <p>Outside of linguistics, my interests include many techy things (I'm
      currently playing around with Emacs again ...), strategy games, and the novels
      of Iain M. Banks.</p>
