      <h1>About</h1> <img src="pictures/jamie_oxford.png" alt="Me in Oxford"
      id="oxford_pic"/>
      <p>I am a theoretical linguist: I aim to understand how human language
        works by coming up with theories about it and then testing them. In
        particular, I am interested in the structure of sentences (syntax), how
        the meanings of sentences are computed (semantics), and the ways in
        which these two interact.</p>

      <p>Professionally, I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in Semantics at
        the University of Oslo, working on
        the <a href="https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/research/projects/universal-natural-language-understanding/index.html">Universal
        Natural Language Understanding project</a>. Prior to this, I was a
        Departmental Lecturer in Syntax at the University of Oxford, where my
        teaching included general linguistics, syntax, and sociolinguistics.</p>

      <p>Research-wise, I am interested in well-formalised theories of grammar
        and meaning, especially constraint-based, non-derivational theories
        (such as Lexical Functional Grammar</a> and Glue Semantics). I'm also
        always keen for opportunities to explore the relationships between
        different linguistic theories &#8211; where they diverge and how testable
        those differences are.</p>

      <p>My recent work has mostly focussed on the syntax and semantics of
        idioms and other multiword expressions, investigating how they should be
        represented in the mental lexicon. I also study the principles behind
        how the semantic arguments of a predicate are realised syntactically,
        otherwise known as Mapping Theory.</p>

      <p>Beyond syntax and semantics, I am interested in sociolinguistics,
        and especially in the intersection of language, gender, and
        sexuality.</p>

      <p>Outside of linguistics, I enjoy techy things (I'm currently playing
        around with Emacs again ...), strategy games (of both the board and PC
        variety), and silly wordplay ("You have a daughter don't you?" "Yea,
        Henrietta" "Did he? I'm sorry to hear that"). </p>
