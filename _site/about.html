<p><img src="assets/images/jamie_oxford.png" alt="Me in Oxford" /></p>

<p>I am a theoretical linguist: I aim to understand how human language
works by coming up with theories about it and then testing them. In
particular, I am interested in the structure of sentences (syntax), how
the meanings of sentences are computed (semantics), and the ways in
which these two interact.</p>

<p>Professionally, I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in Semantics at the
University of Oslo, working on the <a href="https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/research/projects/universal-natural-language-understanding/index.html">Universal Natural Language
Understanding
project</a>.
Prior to this, I was a Departmental Lecturer at the University of
Oxford, where my teaching included general linguistics, syntax, and
sociolinguistics.</p>

<p>Research-wise, I am interested in well-formalised theories of grammar
and meaning, especially constraint-based, non-derivational theories
(such as Lexical Functional Grammar and Glue Semantics). I'm also
always keen for opportunities to explore the relationships between
different linguistic theories â€“ where they diverge and how testable
those differences are.</p>

<p>My recent work has mostly focussed on the syntax and semantics of idioms
and other multiword expressions, investigating how they should be
represented in the mental lexicon. I also study the principles behind
how the semantic arguments of a predicate are realised syntactically,
otherwise known as Mapping Theory.</p>

<p>Beyond syntax and semantics, I am interested in sociolinguistics, and
especially in the intersection of language, gender, and sexuality.</p>

<p>Outside of linguistics, I enjoy techy things (I'm currently playing
around with Emacs again ...), strategy games (of both the board and PC
variety), and bad puns ("You have a daughter don't you?" "Yea,
Henrietta" "Did he? I'm sorry to hear that").</p>
